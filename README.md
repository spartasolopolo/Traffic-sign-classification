# Traffic-sign-classification
Traffic sign classification

# Project Summary
In this project, we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build, train, and test a traffic sign classification model. 
We will build this model using TensorFlow and Keras.
It is a multiclass classification problem.
This model can be used to make smart cars.
After this project, you will be able to create a MultiClass Classification model using Deep Learning
