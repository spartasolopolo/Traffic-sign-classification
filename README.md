# Traffic-sign-classification
Traffic sign classification

# Project Summary
In this project, we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build, train, and test a traffic sign classification model. 
We will build this model using TensorFlow and Keras.
It is a multiclass classification problem.
This model can be used to make smart cars.
After this project, you will be able to create a MultiClass Classification model using Deep Learning

# Steps involved to solve this project
1. Finding data on Kaggle and loading it into Collab
2. Preporcessing the images and visualizing them
3. Finding out the mean of the dimensions and resizing all images accordingly
4. Converting the images into a NumPy array and normalizing them
5. Checking class imbalance
6. Splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding
7. Creating the model architecture, compiling the model and then fitting it
8. Plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch
9. Preprocessing the test data and make predictions on it
10. Visualizing the original and predicted labels for the test images
